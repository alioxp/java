This project has been built using the Forte(TM) Java Development Environment
from Sun.  This is for download available at http://www.sun.com/forte/ffj/ce/
You should be able to use any other Java IDE fairly simply.
Once you have compiled the source you can use the makettftp script to build
the .tini file in the bin directory.

At present, the .tini file produces a stand alone TFTP command program.
Usage is as follows:

java ttftp.tini get <host> <filename>
java ttftp.tini put <host> <filename>
